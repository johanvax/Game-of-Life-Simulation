# How to use
To run, type `java Main 100 100`. This creates a world of 100x100. You can of course change the arguments to any positive integers as you see fit. Add a third argument (int bestween 0 and 100) for additional probability. 

First, a small window should appear where you first pick a color for tiles that are alive, then pick a color for tiles that are dead. When the dead color is chosen, the main window should appear.
To make a single iteration, press spacebar. To keep iterating, hold enter.
