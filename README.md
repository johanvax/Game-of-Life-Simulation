To run, type 'java Main 100 100'. This creates a world of 100x100. You can of course change the arguments to any positive integers as you see fit.

When a window appears, you should be able to resize it as you want. To make a single iteration, press spacebar. To keep iterating, hold enter.

Note: At the moment you can't change the colors without editing the code. This can be done in the 'render' function of the class 'Gameoflife' (I might change it later :))
