Run by using like 'java Main <rows> <cols>'. The arguments are for big you want your world to be. 

When a window appears, you should be able to resize it as you want. To make a single iteration, press your spacebar once. To keep iterating, hold enter.

Note: At the moment you can't change the colors without editing the code. This can be done in the 'render' function of the class 'Gameoflife'. I might change it later :)
